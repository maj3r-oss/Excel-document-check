# Excel-document-check
_MDR Link_
This program is used on an internal excel file to create windows shortcuts of project files. 
It asks for two excel files, one with the list of documents with latest revision number, second with Folder nesting. 
It also asks for the root directory where the shortcuts are to be made.
This program is not meant for external use and only uploaded here to be shared as an example of my rudimentary knowledge of python. 
Thankyou.
